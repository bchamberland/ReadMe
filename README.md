## Bennett.ReadMe  (work in progress)


### This is ...
A quick way to:
* Introduce me as a human.
* Answer some likely questions.
* Set expectations around what you can expect from me as your Engineering Manager

NOT meant as a replacement for actually getting to know each other.

### This isn’t ...
Laying out:
* My expectations of you.
* Plans for our team, product, or company.
* Our team or Citrix's operational processes.

### About me

Family
* Spouse: Dani
* Kids: Casey (4 in Dec), Elisabeth (4 months old)
* Pets: Dory (dog), Bruce (cat)

Me
* Born in Canada because Northern Maine didn't have any nearby hospitals (#DualCitizen)
* Lived in Maine until ~7 years ago, still don't like driving here

Interests
* Bruins. Seriously, its a problem
* Legos. Costly problem
* Gaming. Board games and Video games like Hearthstone or Xcom

### My role
My job is to enable the team to be productive.
* Recruit the best possible new people. 
* Work with each person to help them be successful.
* Help bridge the gap between high-level company objectives and our concrete deliverables. The product team and I work together to provide context and explain priorities. I also keep an eye out for places where the strategy might be unclear, or where a particular project’s purpose may have strayed.
* Process improvements. Sometimes we need “machinery” like the steps to follow to plug in a new 3rd party service.  Maybe there’s too much process bogging us down, and we can streamline things.
* I keep my entire world on trello boards. If you ever want to see, just ask. I will never hide my priorites or what I'm doing. 

I serve you, not the other way around. I’m always available to assist; even if my schedule looks full, I’ll make the time.
### My favorite question is: “why?”
I’ve found that when projects go off the tracks, it’s usually because there was some miscommunication or lack of agreement about the purpose. People often jump to the specific steps of “what we’ll do…” without making sure they’re all on the same page first. Even though it can sometimes sound redundant or pedantic, please bear with me when I ask “why” again and again - it’s really hard to be over-aligned on the fundamentals.
If you're wondering, my second favorite question is "Can we automate that?"
Followed closely by "Where the \**** did I put my coffee?"
### Any metric is better than none
I like thinking through business decisions using metrics and measurements whenever possible. Even rough estimates or imperfect measurements still help convey general order-of-magnitude and trends. And metrics give us proof that we're achieveing or failing our goals.
### Process and Software Development
* I strongly believe in putting people over process and changing process to accommodate our needs and goals. I’ve worked with and without Agile, with and without a form of Scrum. At the end of the day, these are my values: 
* I value transparency about what’s happened, what’s happening, and what’s going to happen.
* I value speed, including proactive efforts that keep us moving quickly at a sustainable pace (e.g. writing tests, refactoring legacy code before a new feature, pairing on work to improve our code quality and bus factor)
* I value learning, and know that training up on a tech stack may not always be the fastest route to production.
* I value your time and don’t want you to do any process that is neither beneficial to you nor required by law, policy, Citrix, etc.

### My time and attention are limited - I’d love your help!
Practically speaking, the list of projects/problems I’m actively thinking about can only be about 4-5 items deep; beyond that, certain items will drop in priority. While I do my best to keep an active to-do list, I’ll need some help from my team.
* If I’m getting too involved in a project that you think is going OK, please let me know you’ve got it!
* If you have a critical problem, let me know - even if my schedule is full, we can make time.
* If I didn’t follow up on something important, hold me accountable and let me know. I may sometimes drop the ball. If I’m unable to handle everything on my list, that’s often a sign I should delegate or re-prioritize.

### One on Ones (1:1s)
* We will have bi-weekly 1:1s at a time that works for both of us. If you prefer weekly, I will work with you to make that happen. 
* 1:1s are first and foremost for you - you decide the discussion topics! 
* 1:1s are not for status updates unless you want to update status.
* I will do my best to not reschedule a 1:1, but there may be times when I have to (eg. company all hands meetings, illness, vacation, etc.).
* If you ever need to reschedule a 1:1, please let me know!

### Want to Talk? Let’s Talk!
My responsibilities cover several areas and teams.
Very few of my responsibilities are more important than talking with you if you want to talk with me!
Please feel free to reach out ad-hoc via Slack, or to put time on my calendar to talk whenever you want.
* You may not find a slot on my calendar.
* If you want to talk, let’s talk!
* Let me know via Slack and I’ll make time.

### Feedback is very important to me.
In situations where anonymous feedback is suggested, you’ll probably hear me suggesting that you provide direct feedback, though anonymous feedback is better than none. I’m dedicated to giving you clear and timely feedback and hope that you’ll give me the same. I believe that feedback requires three attributes:
* Safety (you should feel safe to give and receive candid feedback) 
* Effort (neither you nor I should feel defensive about the feedback) 
* Benefit (giving/receiving feedback should have impact)
Please let me know if I’m doing poorly on any of these attributes. I’ll return the favor!

### When I Have Feedback For You
My intent with feedback is to help you grow and improve.
* I will always assume that you have positive intent, and that I may not have the full context of any particular situation, so I will ask you to share the additional context that you have.
* I will work with you to identify strategies to work on improving things going forward, as well as identify ways that I and the larger team/company can support you.

### When You Have Feedback For Me
I recognize that giving feedback, especially to your manager, may feel uncomfortable. Know that I view feedback as a gift since it allows me to grow and improve, which ultimately helps not only me, but also you, the team, and the company.
Provide feedback in the way that you’re most comfortable with (email, Slack, video chat, etc.).
If for some reason you’re not comfortable giving me certain feedback directly, please don’t remain silent - you can always talk to Bill (My manager)

### Questions I will ask you: 
* Tell me about yourself. What's your career been so far? What do you do for fun?
* How do you like feedback? (written, in person, etc.)
* How do you like to be recognized? (privately, publicly, to just the team, etc.?)
* What makes 1 on 1s most valuable for you? Agenda topics, weekly, biweekly, walking, review goals every time or ad hoc, etc.
* Current short term goals? Long term goals?
* Expectations for me?
* Like to track agenda and notes in shared doc? 
* What's your worst day like? Best day?
